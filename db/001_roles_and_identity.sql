-- 001: roles, extensions, the acting member, and the directory mirror.
--
-- Spaces is an application from us beside the Business OS kernel (maludb-os-integration 0.7.0): the business's
-- collaborative workspace — Notion and Slack in one — and a DEFAULT of every install (design docs/spaces-design.md, D3).
-- It owns the business's WRITTEN COLLABORATION: spaces, pages built from blocks, databases, channels and messages; the
-- kernel owns the DIRECTORY and the agents. The identity tables below are a MIRROR of the kernel's directory with the
-- kernel's ids -- written only from a hand-off token's claims or the directory change feed, never generated here. There is
-- no password and no account: a member signs in at the kernel's launcher; a guest is a kernel member flagged external
-- holding the Guest role; the public never signs in at all (a published page's token is its authority — db/007, design §4).
--
-- THE ESTATE'S DATA MODEL (shared-schema.md; design §6.1): this file is the kernel contract as Consultant Tracking db/001
-- carries it, copied verbatim (ct_ → sp_); `members` APPENDS four columns for Slack's status and presence. Reused tables are
-- created here, by this application's own migrations, whichever siblings an installation holds.
--
-- Run in order as postgres on an empty database named <tenant>_spaces:
--   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d subello_spaces -f db/001_roles_and_identity.sql
-- The installer sets the three role passwords afterwards (ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD).
